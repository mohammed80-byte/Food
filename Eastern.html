        Eastern food is an extremely broad and unspecific term that encompasses the diverse culinary traditions of multiple continents, most notably Asia and the Middle East. It is not a singular cuisine, but a vast category that includes hundreds of distinct regional and national food styles.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, within Asia, “Eastern food” refers to everything from the refined dishes of East Asia (like China, Japan, and Korea) to the fragrant curries of South Asia (like India and Bangladesh) and the aromatic dishes of Southeast Asia (like Thailand and Vietnam). Common themes across these regions include the use of rice, noodles, fresh vegetables, and a wide array of spices and herbs.

        Similarly, Middle Eastern food uses staples like chickpeas, lentils, lamb, and a distinct palette of spices to create dishes such as hummus, kebabs, and falafel.

        Therefore, due to its immense geographic scope and cultural diversity, the term “Eastern food” lacks a precise definition and is considered a vague oversimplification by many food experts.

       Western cuisine encompasses a diverse range of cooking traditions originating from European countries, the Americas, and Australasia. Influenced heavily by classic French techniques, many Western meals feature meat, dairy, and wheat products as staples. Roasting, baking, and grilling are common cooking methods.
      </p>
      <p>
Typical Western dinners are often structured around a protein, like beef or chicken, with a starchy side dish such as potatoes or pasta, and vegetables. Courses are usually served separately, starting with soups or salads and ending with desserts like pastries or cakes
      </p>
      <p>
       Unlike some Asian cooking, which emphasizes smaller portions and a high volume of vegetables, Western meals historically focus on larger, meat-centric servings. Sauces are a foundational component, with many modern variations derived from the five French "mother sauces". Fast-food variations like hamburgers and pizza have also become widely known as Western food.
